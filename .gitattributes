#
# A gitattributes file is a simple text file that gives attributes to path names.
# Each line in gitattributes file is of form: pattern attr1 attr2 ...
# That is, a pattern followed by an attributes list, separated by white spaces.
# When the pattern matches the path in question, the attributes listed on the line are given to the path.
# Each attribute can be in one of these states for a given path:

# FIX CRLF always when developer has not set
# Linux/Mac: git config --global core.autocrlf input
# Windows: git config --global core.autocrlf true
# Auto detect text files and perform LF normalization
* eol=lf
* text=auto
*.md text
*.yml text
*.yaml text
.editorconfig text
.gitattributes text
.gitignore text
.mailmap text

# generally repository is place for source code not for binaries, but is needed
# then something like following could be set e.g.
# your-bin -diff or
# diff "your-bin"]
#   textconv = ps2ascii
#   binary = true
# Ensure those won't be messed up with
*.gif  binary
*.jpeg binary
*.png binary
*.jpg binary
